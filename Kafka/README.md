# Definition
* Kafka = Kafa is a Streaming Platform
* Kafka is distributed system , which means it can scaleup as needed

# ToRead
* Kafka can process large amount of data in a short amount of time.
* Kafka has low latency, making it possible to process the data in real-time. 
* Kafka is written in Scala & Java  

# Terminology
* Fault tolerance 
* Resilient 
* Broker = Server 
* Kafka Node = Kafka Server
* Publish = Write 
* Subscribe = Read 
* Topic = Logic name / Logical entity which will be sending the data 
* Message is pushed to Partition 
* Round Robin Strategy 
* Topic ---> Broker --> Partition 
* Throughput 
* Zookeeper is internal component to manage Brokers 
* Zookeeper cluster 
* Broker = Server / Node 
* Distributed Systems 
* Redundancy = Replica 
* Read ( Consumer ) & Write Operation ( Producer ) 
* Set of brokers form Cluster 
* Leader Partition & Follower Partitions 
* Partition is replicated 
* Produce messages to Topic 
* Producer & Consumer are independent 
* Consumer should subscribe to Topic 
* Producer will send data / message to Broker 
* Consumer is single threaded 
* Offset number is different for different partition 
* Producer 
* Consumer 
* Schema 
* Message 
* Broker 
* Partition 
* Topic 
* Leader Partition & Follower Partition 
* Leader Broker 
* Producer Partition 
* 3 Acknowledgement Modes 
* Producer Record 
* Key 
* Value 
* Console Producer 
* Java Producer 
* OffSet 
* Delivery Semantics -- At least once, At most once, Exactly once 
* Latency 
* Buffer Size 
* Message Size 
* Throwput 
* Durable on Disk 
* Data Retention 
* Data Format 
* Replica 
* Message or Data Format ( JSON )
